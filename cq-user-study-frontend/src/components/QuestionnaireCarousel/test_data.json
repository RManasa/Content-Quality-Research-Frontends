        "text": "In non-relativistic or classical physics, the concept of time generally used is that of absolute time (also called Newtonian time after its most famous proponent), time which is independent of any perceiver, progresses at a consistent pace for everyone everywhere throughout the universe, and is essentially imperceptible and mathematical in nature. This accords with most peopleâ€™s everyday experience of how time flows. However, since the advent of relativity in the early 20th Century, relativistic time has become the norm within physics. This takes into account phenomena such as time dilation for fast-moving objects, gravitational time dilation for objects caught in extreme gravitational fields, and the important idea that time is really just one element of four-dimensional space-time. Relativity also allows for, at least in theory, the prospect of time travel, and there are several scenarios which allow for the theoretical basis of travel in time. There are even theoretical faster-than-light time-travelling particles like tachyons and neutrinos. However, the concept of time travel also brings with it a number of paradoxes, and its likelihood and physical practicality is questioned by many physicists. Most physicists agree that time had a beginning, and that it is measured from, and indeed came into being with, The Big Bang some 13.8 billion years ago. Whether, how and when time might end in the future is a more open question, depending on different notions of the ultimate fate of the universe and other mind-bending concepts like the multiverse. The so-called arrow of time refers to the one-way direction or asymmetry of time, which leads to the way we instinctively perceive time as moving forwards from the fixed and immutable past, though the present, towards the unknown and unfixed future. This idea has it roots in physics, particularly in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, although other, often related, arrows of time have also been identified.",
