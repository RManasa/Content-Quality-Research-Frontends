        "text": "Flight According to 20th century folklore, the laws of aerodynamics prove that the bumblebee should be incapable of flight, as it does not have the capacity (in terms of wing size or beat per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary. Not being aware of scientists 'proving' it cannot fly, the bumblebee succeeds under \"the power of its own arrogance\". The origin of this myth has been difficult to pin down with any certainty. John McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years McMasters has backed away from this origin, suggesting that there could be multiple sources, and that the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 French book Le vol des insectes by M. Magnan. Magnan is reported to have written that he and a Mr. Saint-Lague had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight was impossible, but that \"One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality\". It is believed that the calculations which purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall, an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing, which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows that the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle. - Buzz One common, yet incorrect, assumption is that the buzzing sound of bees is caused by the beating of their wings. The sound is the result of the bee vibrating its flight muscles, and this can be done while the muscles are decoupled from the wings, a feature known in bees but not possessed by other insects. This is especially pronounced in bumblebees, as they must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures.[4] This is how bumblebees can sometimes reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).\" Source and further information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee#Bumblebee_myths",

This was back in the 1950's and Mr. LeClaire came to a juicing demonstration even though he shook so much from Parkinson's disease he could not hold a cup and sample any of the juices. Nevertheless he bought a juicer. The next year when I returned to Florida, Mr. LeClaire approached the front of the room and shook my hand without trembling. I was amazed. He explained that he had put himself on a regimen of carrot juice, wheatgrass juice, and leafy greens. Wheatgrass juice was the centerpiece of his diet and he consumed six ounces every day. Fascinated, I accepted his invitation to his rooming house to see how he grew wheatgrass in trays, using carrot and leafy green waste for compost and growing worms to aerate the soil in five-gallon, stainless steel milk cans. Since that day, I have believed as strongly as anyone in the power of wheatgrass.\" That was quite the experience. I do not have Parkinson's, but if I did, you can bet I would sure give that wheatgrass a try. (Incidentally, the author goes on to advice never to drink more than two ounces of wheatgrass juice at a time. It is best to start off slowly. Wheatgrass juice is very sweet and may make you nauseated.)",

You can buy seeds on the internet. The only problem is that you wont know how much l-dopa you are getting and wont get the carbidopa component which blocks the nausea assocated with l-dopa. I guess if Sinemet becomes unavailable it might be useful. The best alternative treatment for Parkinson's is regular exercise and avoidance of obesity. Treadmill walking seems to preserve the gait.",

This means that by breaking the light from an object into it's various wavelengths (for visible light, different wavelengths is the same as different colors; for other parts of the spectrum \u2013 ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays, infrared, and radio \u2013 we just say \"wavelengths\"), we can look for the fingerprints of different atoms and molecules. By now you've guessed that this is exactly how we work out what stars and planets are made of, for the most part.

I have it and it is very easy to use. It has tutorials and everything. I have no idea how much it costs. But, If you have .NET you can make a project classified as 'Web Project.' .NET has all the main programming languages so this is most helpful. .NET is a FULL and easy to use ALL AREA programming software.
